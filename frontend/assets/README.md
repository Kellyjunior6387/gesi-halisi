# GasChain Assets Directory

This directory contains all static assets for the GasChain mobile application.

## Directory Structure

### `/images/`
Contains image assets such as logos, icons, and illustrations.

**Required assets:**
- `logo.png` - Main application logo (150x150px recommended)
- Place any additional images here

### `/lottie/`
Contains Lottie animation files for dynamic UI elements.

**Recommended animations:**
- `safety.json` - Animation for "Safe Gas for Everyone" onboarding page
- `blockchain.json` - Animation for "Powered by Blockchain" onboarding page  
- `ai_assistant.json` - Animation for "AI Assistant in Swahili" onboarding page

## Adding Assets

1. Place your assets in the appropriate directory
2. Ensure assets are optimized for mobile (compressed, appropriate resolution)
3. Update the code references if using actual asset files instead of placeholders

## Security Note
- Do NOT place sensitive data, API keys, or credentials in asset files
- All assets should be publicly safe to distribute
- Optimize images to reduce app size

## Current Status
Currently using placeholder icons in the UI. Replace with actual assets when available.
